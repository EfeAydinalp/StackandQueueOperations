# Stack and Queue Operations

This project implements several operations on custom stack and queue data structures in Java. The operations are performed based on commands read from an input file (`command.txt`), and the results are output to separate files for stack and queue (`stackOut.txt` and `queueOut.txt`).

## Features
- **Remove Greater Number:** Removes all elements greater than a specified value from the stack or queue.
- **Calculate Distance of Elements:** Computes the sum of distances of all elements to every other element in the stack or queue.
- **Add or Remove Elements:** Adds or removes a specified number of random elements to/from the stack or queue.
- **Reverse Elements:** Reverses the first `k` elements of the stack or queue.
- **Sorting Elements:** Sorts all elements in the stack or queue.
- **Distinct Elements:** Counts the number of distinct elements in the stack or queue.

## How to Run
1. **Compilation:** Compile your Java files using the following command:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```
1. **Run your program:** 
   ```bash
   java Main command.txt
   ```
1. **Control your output.**
